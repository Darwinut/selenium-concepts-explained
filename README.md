# Selenium Concepts Explained
This repo includes fundamental concepts of selenium web driver along with JAVA, and it gets updated as I explore one by one with much detail. I am hoping to build this repo as a one-stop reference for anyone who would like to understand selenium and learn JAVA along the way.

# Creating a webdriver object:

Class: Includes datatypes, methods. Templates to create objects. 

Interface: Same as class. Only methods are declared inside the interface. Its implementation are found inside the implementation class (which inherits Interface).

Implementation Class: Implement the abstract methods of an interface in their way. Eg: FirefoxDriver , ChromeDriver etc.

Object: Objects are created to access the methods of a class from outside  

New: Is a keyword/Java operator, used to create a memory for the object and is followed by a call to a constructor. which initializes the new object.  

# Example: 
```sh
webdriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
```

Webdriver - Interface

new - keyword/Java operator

ChromeDriver - Implementation Class
